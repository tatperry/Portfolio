        Named for the remnants of glaciers from the ice age, Glacier National
        Park is located on the border of Canada and the United States and is
        often called the "Crown of the Continent" since it sits at the
        headwaters of the streams that flow into the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of
        Mexico and Hudson Bay. A favorite among hikers, the park features a
        variety of trails for all skill levels, ranging from the easy Trail of
        the Cedars to the challenging Grinnell Glacier. What's more, the park
        boasts more than 700 lakes, numerous waterfalls and two mountain ranges,
        spread across more than 1 million acres that shelter an array of
        wildlife. Aside from its breathtaking geological features, it's also
        home to a fair amount of history. The Going-to-the-Sun Road – a scenic,
        52-mile drive through the park – is a National Historic Landmark and an
        engineering marvel that offers spectacular views, as well as access to
        popular hiking trails. Plus, many of the park's lodges, chalets and
        hotels were constructed by the Great Northern Railway in the early 20th
        century and are on the National Register of Historic Places.
