        One of Canada's wildest places, Jasper National Park provides
        kaleidoscopic panoramas at every turn. Travelers can marvel at many
        views as they trek from the peaks of Mount Edith Cavell to the caverns
        of Maligne Canyon. Located on the eastern edge of Alberta, the park
        serves as a beacon for adventurers in the Northern Hemisphere. Jasper
        boasts the distinction of being the largest park in the Canadian Rockies
        and was designated part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with
        Banff and a handful of additional parks. With more than 2.7 million
        acres of land to explore, travelers are sure to spot animals ranging
        from caribou to wolverine to moose. The park offers all the natural
        wonders you'd expect, including mountains and rivers and even glaciers,
        but the town of Jasper elevates the park's possibilities. In addition to
        serving as a convenient base camp, Jasper provides a variety of tours
        and excursions for travelers to utilize. Not to mention, winter in
        Jasper means travelers can enjoy cold-weather activities like skiing in
        Marmot Basin or snowshoeing through the backcountry. No matter the
        season, there's always a reason to visit Jasper.
