        Towering above Jackson Hole Valley with jagged snow-topped peaks,
        Wyoming's majestic Teton Mountains are in high relief at Grand Teton
        National Park. From the 13,770-foot Grand Teton to the glittering Jenny
        and Jackson lakes – which reflect the mountains in their depths – the
        photo ops are endless. But the park isn't just for mountaineers and
        photographers. In the peak summer season, the area's trails call to
        hikers of all abilities and reveal gems like hidden waterfalls and
        breathtaking views of the Tetons. Meanwhile, the Snake River appeals to
        kayakers, rafters and those that simply fancy a float, and historic
        districts like Menors Ferry and Mormon Row attract history buffs
        interested in the 19th-century past of this piece of Western Frontier.
        The nearly 500-square-mile park also contains a range of wildlife,
        including black bears, grizzlies, moose, antelope and bison, and for
        autumn visitors, the park lights up with golden aspens. Plus, travelers
        that want to tick off another national park on the same vacation can
        travel the few miles north to Yellowstone, which adjoins Grand Teton
        (you'll save $10 on combined admission if you choose to visit both
        parks).
