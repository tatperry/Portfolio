        With dramatic peaks and pristine lakes, Yellowstone National Park is an
        outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Multicolored pools swirl around hot
        springs; verdant forests weave past expansive meadows; and volatile
        geysers launch streams of steaming water toward the sky. With so much
        unspoiled natural beauty, it's no wonder why everyone suspected John
        Colter (a scout for explorers Lewis and Clark) was embellishing when he
        first described Yellowstone's geothermal curiosities in 1807. Nowadays,
        there's no doubt that the park is indeed extraordinary. While you
        traverse its 3,000-plus square miles of mountains, canyons, geysers and
        waterfalls, be prepared to share the trails with permanent residents
        like buffalo, elk and sometimes even grizzlies. Although Yellowstone
        attracts more than 4 million visitors every year, chances are – unless
        you spend your entire trip at Old Faithful – you won't see much of them.
        Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres creep from the northwest corner of
        Wyoming into the edges of Idaho and Montana, offering plenty of
        untouched territory to explore. Carve out a day or two to take in the
        view at Yellowstone Lake and Mammoth Hot Springs. But save some time for
        the trails through lesser-known regions, like the hot springs of the
        West Thumb Geyser Basin and the untamed wildlife dotting the Lewis River
        Channel and Dogs-head Loop. While the sheer number of trails and
        wildlife-watching opportunities may seem daunting at first, remember:
        You can always come back.
