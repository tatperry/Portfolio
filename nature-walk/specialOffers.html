      <p class="spain-para">
        Blackwater Falls State Park is one of nature’s crowning achievements and
        West Virginia's most visited park. While its 2,358 acres of rugged
        natural beauty and towering hardwoods certainly don’t lack standout,
        jaw-dropping, Instagram-worthy features, the iconic Falls themselves are
        indisputably the park’s crown jewel. There’s just something thrilling
        about seeing, hearing and feeling the tannin-stained Blackwater River
        crash six stories over the falls into the natural pool 62 feet below.
        The falls provide an entirely different perspective each season—autumn
        frames the cascade with fiery color, while the cold of winter often
        leaves it eerily suspended in time. A boardwalk makes it easy to get
        quite close, though other trails provide different viewpoints with
        varying difficulty While the famous falls are certainly aesthetically
        pleasing and a must-see experience, Blackwater Falls State Park has much
        to offer outside of Blackwater Falls. A true four-season destination,
        Blackwater Falls State Park has something to offer for everyone, all
        year round.

        While enjoying the park's lakes, ponds and streams visitors are asked
        not to jump or dive from bridges, rocks or cliffs. The maximum speed
        limit in the park is 35 mph. Conservation officers and park rangers
        enforce the park’s laws and regulations. Guests are asked to leash pets
        and they need to be on a leash that is no longer than 10 feet in length.
        Pets are not allowed in any park buildings or on designated swimming
        beaches. Guests are asked not to leave pets unattended. In Custer State
        Park warm days and cool nights are common in the summer, but July and
        August are typically hot. Moderate temperatures usually prevail in the
        winter months with some below zero temperatures. Afternoon thunderstorms
        in the summer may bring lightning, hail, strong winds and heavy rains.
        Snow may fall as early as September and may last until mid-May. Bison
        are the park’s biggest attraction but remember these animals are
        dangerous, so please give them plenty of space. While hiking, biking or
        horseback riding in Custer State Park visitors should be aware of
        prairie rattlesnakes, ticks and poison ivy. Campers and hikers should
        never drink water from lakes, streams or springs in Custer State Park.
        While photographing wildlife and scenery, please pull off the roadways
        and be aware of what is going on around you at all times. Cell phone
        reception is spotty throughout the park. Rock climbing is allowed in
        Custer State Park. The park encourages visitors to only rock climb under
        the supervision of trained instructors.
