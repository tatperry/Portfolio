        Incredible, extraordinary, mind-boggling … try as you might, you'll have
        difficulty finding words that do justice to the sheer beauty of Lake
        Tahoe. Resting on the California-Nevada border, Lake Tahoe has long been
        a favorite vacation spot, welcoming upward of 2.7 million people a year.
        Visitors are drawn here by the steep granite cliff sides and towering
        mountaintops, as well as the crystal-clear waters that have earned Lake
        Tahoe the reputation of being one of the most beautiful bodies of water
        in the United States. While the stunning blue lake alone is worth a
        trip, the surrounding area, also known as Lake Tahoe, boasts miles of
        hiking trails, dozens of picture-perfect vistas and some of the best
        skiing in North America. But wait – there's more. Lake Tahoe seems to
        have adopted the major traits of its neighbors. You'll find San
        Francisco-style high-end shopping and dining along the lake's north
        shore, while opportunities to test your luck reside in the south shore's
        Reno-esque casinos. You'll also find plenty of activities that Lake
        Tahoe is proud to take credit for, including mountain gondola rides, hot
        air balloon adventures and scenic cruises across the mirror-like water.
