        Big Sur is not just a destination, it's a state of mind. Stretching 90
        miles between Monterey Bay and San Simeon on the west coast of central
        California, Big Sur's remote location, peaceful nature and incomparable
        beauty entices visitors to change gears, both figuratively and
        literally. Pacific Coast Highway, which was built less than 100 years
        ago, is the main road that runs through the region and becomes the most
        scenic in Big Sur. Sitting high above the surf, the highway clings to
        the edge of the area's cliffs, providing spectacular views as it weaves
        in and out of the seemingly endless coastline. Driving conditions aside,
        Big Sur's calming culture is contagious, and has been known to attract
        minds of all kinds seeking inspiration, refuge or transformation. It was
        Jack Kerouac who took off to Big Sur in search of inner peace, as
        recounted in his novel "Big Sur." Fellow writer Henry Miller called Big
        Sur the first place he felt at home in America, later penning the memoir
        "Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch." Since then, countless
        musicians, artists, writers and photographers have chronicled Big Sur's
        powerful presence in their work, yet travelers say its grandeur remains
        indescribable. Today, Big Sur draws millions of visitors every year, but
        it still hasn't lost its sense of place. Independent art galleries dot
        the highway, sharing space with wellness retreats and cliffside
        eateries. But the diverse landscape trumps all of the area's amenities
        by a landslide, with state parks and beaches reigning supreme as the
        main attractions. Mountains, beaches, rivers, valleys, creeks, coves,
        wildflowers and wildlife linger at every turn. That is, if you can find
        them. Some of Big Sur's natural attractions are intentionally unmarked
        to preserve the sense of seclusion that the region is so famous for.
        Some areas, believe it or not, still don't have electricity. Big Sur,
        however, is meant to be an experience rather than just a typical
        vacation. So, kick back, unwind, and open your eyes and ears to the
        sights and sounds of Big Sur.
