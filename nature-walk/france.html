        "Grand" doesn't begin to do this canyon justice. Measuring approximately
        277 river miles in length, up to 18 miles in width and a mile deep, this
        massive chasm in northern Arizona is truly a natural wonder. For six
        million years, the Grand Canyon has expanded with the help of the mighty
        Colorado River, and for centuries, people from all over the globe have
        traveled to gaze out over its red and orange grandeur. Managed by the
        National Park Service and officially designated as a UNESCO World
        Heritage site, the Grand Canyon leaves its approximately 6 million
        visitors per year awestruck. But if you're seeking a secluded escape to
        Mother Nature, you should be prepared: The Grand Canyon can be very
        crowded. The South Rim – home to the Grand Canyon Village and the
        well-worn Bright Angel Trail – is particularly popular for sightseers
        and hikers. It is on this side that you'll find the most amenities. For
        a break from the crowds, head to the North Rim. This is the place for
        backwoods camping and hardcore hiking.
